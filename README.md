Android app of French Chinese bilingual dictionary

When I learn French, I always want a simple French dictionary. Unfortunately, most of French dictionaries on market are too heavy for me. This is why I developed this dictionary.

This dictionary can be downloaded from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.helena.essorfrench)

The most important component of a dictionary is a good library. This dictionary is based on [StarDict Dictionaries](http://download.huzheng.org)

However, if you have better library and want to contribute to this project. Please contact me with essorfrench@gmail.com
